            <p>You will have an opportunity to receive up to a 6 E$ bonus by answering the following question:</p>

                {% formfield player.belief_average with label="In how many of the 6 decisions do you think that the B-participants followed the message on average? Please enter a number between 0.0 and 6.0" %}
                &nbsp;
            <p>Note that the true number may involve decimals as it is the average over several B-players.</p>

            <p>You receive additional money for the accuracy of your estimates: the better your estimates, the more money.
                You are paid 6 E$ if your estimate deviates by at most 0.2 from the true value.
                For a deviation of at most 1, you are paid 2 E$ and you are paid nothing for larger deviations.</p>
