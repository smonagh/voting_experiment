        In this experiment, you will interact in groups of four participants. You will not learn the identity of these participants,
        neither before nor after the study. None of the other participants will learn of your identity.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the beginning of this experiment,
        we assign three out of any four participants in this experiment to be participants of Type A and one out of any four to be a participant of Type B.
        This assignment was made randomly. This random procedure assigned you to be a <strong>Type A</strong> participant.
    </p>

    <p>
        The composition of the groups will change at random after each decision.
        For each decision your group will therefore consist of different participants.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>
            In each period of this study, the three Type A participants in a group receive information on the value of two projects,
            Project X and Project Y.
        </strong>
        The two projects differ in terms of whether Type A participants or the Type B participant benefit more.
        That is, your payoffs are either smaller or larger, depending on which project is chosen.
        <i>The Type B participant will decide which of these projects will be implemented</i>.
        The only information that participant B
        will have for making this decision is the information that participants of Type A will send to him/her in a message.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>
            Participants of Type A can send one of two messages:
        </strong>
    </p>

    <ul>Message X: “Project X will earn you more money than Project Y.”</ul>
    <ul>Message Y: “Project Y will earn you more money than Project X.”</ul>
