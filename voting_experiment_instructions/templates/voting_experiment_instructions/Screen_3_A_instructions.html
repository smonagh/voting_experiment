    <h1>Your Role and the Sequence of Voting Decisions</h1>

    <p>A random procedure assigned some of the participants in this experiment
       to be Type A participants, and others to be Type B participants. This
       random procedure assigned you to be a Type A participant.  </p>

    <p>In this experiment, there will be 18 decision making rounds. In each
       round a group decisions will be made in groups that consist of 4 people.
        In each round, a group consists of three Type A participants A1, A2,
         and A3, and one Type B participant.  </p>

    <p>There are 16 participants in this experiment, so there will be 4 groups,
       given that each group will have 4 participants.  </p>

    <p> The person who was at the very start of the experiment chosen to be of
       Type B, will remain a Type B participant throughout the experiment. </p>

    <p>In each of the 18 decision making rounds, you, as a Type A participant
       will be randomly assigned to one of the four groups and you be randomly
        assigned an identification number A1, A2 or A3 in that group. Thus the
         identity of the other Type A participants in your group, and your
          identification number A1, A2, or A3, can change from round to
          round.</p>

    <p>In each of the 18 making decision making rounds, also Type B participants
       are randomly assigned to one of the groups.  </p>

    <p>You will not learn of the identity of the other three participants in
       your group, neither before, nor after the study. Further, none of the
       other participants in your group will learn of your identity. </p>

    <p>In each of the 18 decision making rounds, each Type A participant will
       vote on whether to recommend to Type B to either implement Project X
       or Project Y. </p>

    <p>Prior to this vote, all three Type A participants will receive
      information about the earnings that you and others receive if Type B
      implements Project X and the earnings if Type B implements Project Y.</p>

    <p>Project X and Project Y may differ in that one has a larger earnings than
       the other. That is, your earnings are either smaller or larger,
       depending on which project is implemented.</p>
       <p>
       The Type B participant will make the decision whether to implement
       Project X or Project Y. Prior to this decision, Type A participants vote
       which message, either Message X or Message Y to send to the Type B
       participant:
       </p>

    <ul>Message X: “Project X will earn you more money than Project Y.”</ul>
    <ul>Message Y: “Project Y will earn you more money than Project X.”</ul>


    <p>The only information that participant B will have for making the decision
       which project to implement is the wording of Message X (Project X will
       earn you more money than Project Y) or the wording Message Y (Project Y
        will earn you more money than Project X), depending on which message was
         sent by Type A participants. </p>

    <p>After receiving the message that was sent by Type A voters, the Type B
      participant will decide which one of the two projects will be implemented.
    </p>
