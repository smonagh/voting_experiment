    <h1> How you earn money</h1>

    <p>Next, participant Type B will choose between implementing Project X or
       Project Y. Which project will be implemented determines your earnings.
        You will receive the earnings associated with the project that
         participant B choses to implement.</p>

    <p>Before, and after making this decision, Type B participant will not know
      of or learn of the earnings that he or she will receive, when Project X
       or Project Y is implemented, nor does Type B know of the earnings that
        Type A participants will receive when Project X or Project Y is
        implemented. </p>

    <p>The only information that the Type B participant has to make this choice
       between implementing Project X or Project Y is the message (Message X or
        Message Y) that your group of Type A participants has sent to him her
         via majority vote. Thus, Type B will only know the wording of the
         message that he or she received, i.e. either the wording of Message X
          or the wording of Message Y.  </p>

    <p>The Type B participant is also not informed about the decision rule that
       was used by Type A participants to send either Message X or Message Y.
        That is, Type B also does not know that </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the number of votes may have differed between Type A participants </li>
      <li>the group of Type A participants sent that message to him or that
        that had received the largest number of votes. </li>
      <li>the decision which message to send was made via majority rule </li>
      <li>a weighted voting method was used in making the decision which message
         to send to him or her </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In sum, all the information that Type B receives that he or she has to
      choose between Project X and Y, and which project was recommended to him
       or her through either Message X or Message Y.</p>

    <p>Once Participant B has chosen between Project X and Project Y a decision
       making round is completed. Then, another decision making round starts.
        There are a total of 18 decision making rounds.</p>

    <p>Your earnings depend on which project was chosen by the Type B
      participant. Once Type B has announced his choice of project, one of the
      three Type A participants will receive the earnings associated with the
      project chosen by the Type B participant. In each round, the one Type A
      participant who receives these earnings is randomly determined. </p>

    <p>As you do not know in which rounds you will receive earnings, your
       decisions in each period might be relevant for how much money you will
        earn in this experiment. </p>
