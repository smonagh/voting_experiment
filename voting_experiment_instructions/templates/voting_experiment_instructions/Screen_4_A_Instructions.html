<h3>Voting Decisions</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>
            Which message to send to the Type B participant will be determined by the following voting procedure:
        </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        You and the other two Type A members will decide by WEIGHTED MAJORITY VOTING which of the two messages
        will be sent to the Type B participant.
        We call this decision making “weighted” because each of the Type A participants may have different number
        of votes that he or she can cast, that is, each participant does not necessarily cast only one vote.
        This means that depending on the number of votes you are allowed to cast,
        your influence over the decision what message will be sent to the Type B participant might change with your number of votes.
        That is, those with more votes have more influence in the decision making.
        The votes for Message X and Message Y are totaled, that is, summed,
        and the message that receives at least 50 percent of the votes will be sent to the Type B participant.
    </p>

    <p>
        Everyone who is in the group of Type A participants will vote at the same time,
        i.e. you will vote simultaneously. Abstention from voting is not possible.
        Each Type A participant has to vote for either Message X or Message Y and use
        all of his or her votes for either voting for Message X or Message Y.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the beginning of each period, you will be randomly allocated a <strong>subject identification number</strong>,
        either A1, A2,or A3.(Thus, your identification number may change from period to period.)
        You will be informed about the number of votes that each person in your group has command over.
        The following table shows an example of the information that you will receive.
    </p>

    <div style = 'background-color:white;border-radius: 25px; padding:20px; '>

    <p>The players in your group have the following number of votes</p>

    <div class = "row">
        <table class="table" style ='background-color:#F5f5f5;width: 85%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'>
            <tr>
                <th><strong>Subject ID</strong></th>
                <th>A1</th>
                <th>A2</th>
                <th>A3</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th><strong>Votes</strong></th>
                <th> 2 </th>
                <th> 2 </th>
                <th> 1 </th>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
        <p> The sum of the votes is <strong> 5 </strong>.</p>
        <p> <strong>The project with at least 3 votes </strong> will be recommended to participant B,</p>

</div>
    &nbsp;
    <p>

        We then ask you to vote on whether to send Message X or Message Y.
        If you have more than one vote, all of your votes have to be given to either Message X or to Message Y.
        Once you and the other Type A participants have cast your votes, the votes for Message X and Message Y will be summed.
        The message that received at least 50 percent of the votes is sent to Participant B.
    </p>
