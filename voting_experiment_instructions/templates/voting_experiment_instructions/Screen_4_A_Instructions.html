<h1>The Voting Procedure</h1>

    <p>Which message the Type A participants will send to the Type B
      participant will be determined by the following majority rule
       voting procedure. .
    </p>

    <p>This majority voting procedure is a weighted majority voting procedure
      because each of the Type A participants may have more than one vote that
      he or she can use to vote in favor of either sending Message X
      (Project X will earn you more money than Project Y) to Type B, or Message
      Y (Project Y will earn you more money than Project X) to Type B. that is,
       some Type A participants may have more votes than other Type A participants.
    </p>

    <p>Each of the Type A participants will vote at the same time. Abstention
      from voting is not possible.</p>

    <p>Each of the Type A participants has to vote for either Message X or
      Message Y and use all of his or her votes for either of these two
      messages.</p>

    <p>After all Type A participants have voted either in favor sending
      Message X or Message Y to Type B, the software automatically and
      accurately sums the votes for each of the two messages. The message that
       receives at least 50 percent of the votes will be sent to the Type B
       participant.</p>

    <p>Note, because the number of votes to recommend either Message X or
      Message Y may differ between some Type A participants and other Type
       A participants, Type A participants with more votes will have more
        influence which message will be recommended for implementation to Type B
         than those Type A participants with fewer votes. </p>

    <p>As was mentioned before, we assign each of the three Type A participants
      with an subject identifier, either A1, A2 or A3. Your identifier can
      change from decision making round to decision making round. In each round,
       the assignment of an identification number to a participant is randomly
       generated. For example, you may be person A2 in the first decision making
        round, A1, in the second round, A2 in the third round, A3 in the fourth
         round, etc.  </p>

    <p>Here is an example of the screen that you will see prior to your voting
       decision. This screen tells you your identification number, in this case
        A1. This screen also informs you about the number of votes assigned to
         you and to the other two Type A participants.  </p>

                <th>A2</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th><strong>Number of Votes</strong></th>
                <th> 2 </th>
                <th> 2 </th>

    </div>

        <p> The sum of the votes is <strong> 5 </strong>.</p>



</div>
    &nbsp;

    <p>In this screen example, you, as the A1 participant, have 2 votes,
       participant A2 has 2 votes and participant A3 has 1 vote. The total
        number of votes is the sum of the individual votes. So the total number
         of votes is 5 (2+2+1) </p>

    <p> After having received this information, and additional about the
      earnings associated Project X and Project Y, as we a little later in
       these instructions, you will vote to send either Message X or
        Message Y to participant Type B. If you have more than one vote,
         all of your votes will to be given to your choice, being either
          Message X or to Message Y.</p>

   <p>Once Type A participants have voted, their votes for Message X and
      Message Y will be summed. </p>

   <p>Majority rule determines which message will be sent to Participant B.
     That message will be send that receives at least 50% of the votes. In
     the example on this screen, 2, 2 and 1 votes – given that the total
     number of votes is 5 - the majority of votes is 3. So, the message with
      at least 3 votes will be send to participant B. </p>
