<h3>The procedure on your computer screen</h3>

    <p>In each round, the first screen, shown below, informs you that you are
       Type A participant and that your subject number is A1.  </p>
    &nbsp;

    <div style = 'background-color:white;border-radius: 25px; padding:20px; '>

        <p>You are now participant <strong>A1</strong></p>
            <p>The players in your group have the following number of votes</p>

        <p> <strong>The project with at least 3 votes </strong> will be recommended to participant B,</p>

</div>

    &nbsp;
  <p>The screen further informs you about the number of votes each Type A
    participant holds and the number of votes that are required to recommend
     a project to the Type B participant. This example screen informs you that
     you have two votes, the sum of the votes of all participants is 5, and that
      the project that receives at least 3 votes will are recommended to
       participant B.  </p>

  <p>The other two Type A participants are A2 and A3. They will seem a similar
     screen as you, letting them know about their subject number and how many
      votes they have. Thus, for example, A3 will see the identical screen as
       you do, with the only exception that that participant is told that he
       or she has the subject identifier A3. Following the example from the
        screen above, A3 will learn from his or her screen that she or she has
         one vote. </p>
  <p>To move on to the next screen, click on “continue”.</p>

  <p>In each round, the second screen informs all Type A participants,
     including you, you about your earnings for Type A and Type B participants
      when either Project X or Project Y is implemented. All participants of
      Type A are informed about the earnings associated with both projects at
       the same time. </p>

  <p>Below is an example screen containing the earnings about Projects X and Y.</p>

    <p>This screen informs you that if project X is chosen to be implemented by
       Type B, each of the Type A participants will earn E$16 and the Type B
        participant will earn E$4.  </p>

    <p>This screen further informs you that if project X is chosen to be
       implemented by Type B, each of the Type A participants will earn E$4 and
        the Type B participant will earn E$16.  </p>

    <p>Recall, at the end of the decision making round, one of the three Type
       A partisans will be randomly chosen to receive the earnings.  </p>

    <p>As noted previously, Type B participant has no information about the
       earnings associated with either of the two projects. Type B participants
        are also not informed about the procedure (total number of votes, votes
         assigned to each voter, the 50% majority of votes required for a
          message to be sent to Type B) by which the group of Type A
           participants decides on the message to be sent. </p>

    <p>To move on to the next screen, click on “continue”. </p>

    <p>In each round, the third screen is the decision screen.
       Here, you will vote on whether to send Message X or Message Y to the
        Type B participant.  </p>

    <p>On this decision screen, you are reminded in the upper row whether you
       are person A1, A2 or A3, and about the number of votes of each
        participant.  </p>

    <p>At the bottom of this screen you are reminded how many votes are needed
      for the majority rule procedure to send either Message X or Message Y to
      the Type B participant.  </p>

    <p>To vote whether to send Message X or Message Y to participant B, use
       the computer mouse to click on that red field which indicates the message
        which you would like to vote for sending to Type B. your choice.
         The upper field is for a vote in favor of sending Message X to
