    <p>This screen informs you that if project X is chosen to be implemented by
       Type B, each of the Type A participants will earn E$16 and the Type B
        participant will earn E$4.  </p>

    <p>This screen further informs you that if project Y is chosen to be
      implemented by Type B, each of the Type A participants will earn E$4
       and the Type B participant will earn E$16.  </p>

    <p>Recall, at the end of the decision making round, one of the three Type
       A participants will be randomly chosen to receive the earnings.  </p>

      for the majority rule procedure to send either Message X or Message Y to
      the Type B participant.  </p>

         the earnings associated with either of the two projects. The Type B
          participant is also not informed about the procedure (total number of
           votes, votes assigned to each voter, that a 50% majority of votes is
            required for a message to be sent to Type B)  </p>
