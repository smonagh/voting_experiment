<h3>The procedure on your computer screen</h3>

    <p>
        The screens in which you make your decisions are structured as follows.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>1)</strong> The first screen in each period informs you about the number of votes each Type A participant holds and the number
        of votes that are required to recommend a project to the Type B participant.
        From this screen, you will learn your subject number and, importantly, how many votes you control in this period.
    </p>
    &nbsp;

    <div style = 'background-color:white;border-radius: 25px; padding:20px; '>
        <p>Your subject id is <strong>A1</strong></p>
            <p>The players in your group have the following number of votes</p>


    <div class = "row">
        <table class="table" style ='background-color:#F5f5f5;width: 85%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'>

            <tr>
                <th><strong>Subject ID</strong></th>
                <th><b>A1 (you)</b></th>
                <th>A2</th>
                <th>A3</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th><strong>Votes</strong></th>
                <th> 3 </th>
                <th> 1 </th>
                <th> 1 </th>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
        <p> The sum of the votes is <strong> 5 </strong>.</p>
        <p> <strong>The project with at least 3 votes </strong> will be recommended to participant B,</p>

</div>

    &nbsp;
    <p>
        You are one of the participants of type A.
        Specifically, you are now participant A1.
        You have two votes, the sum of the votes is 7, and 4 votes are needed for a decision.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>2)</strong> In each period, the second screen that you and the other Type A participants see
        , informs you about the value of Project X and the value of Project Y.
        All participants of Type A are informed about the values of both projects at the same time.
        The Type B participant has no information about the value of either of the two projects.
        The Type B participant is also not informed about the procedure
        (total number of votes, votes assigned to each voter, the 50% majority of votes required for a message to be sent to Type B)
        by which the group of Type A participants decides on the message to be sent.
    </p>

    <p>
        Below is an example screen containing the information about Projects X and Y:
    </p>

    &nbsp;

    <div style = 'background-color: white;border-radius: 25px; padding:20px;'>
    <div class = "row" >
        &nbsp;

                <th style = 'border-color:black;border-style:solid'>

                <th style = 'border-color:black;border-style:solid'>
                    <p><strong>Project Y</strong></p>
                </th>

            </tr>
            <tr style = 'border-color:black; border-style:solid'>
                <td style = 'border-color:black;border-style:solid'>
                    <p> If participant B chooses project <strong>X</strong></p>
                    <p>One participant in your group will receive <strong>E$ 12</strong> </p>
                    <p>Player type B will receive <strong>E$ 8</strong></p>
                </td>
                <td style = 'border-color:black; border-style:solid'>
                    <p> If participant B chooses project <strong>Y</strong></p>
                    <p>One participant in your group will receive <strong>E$ 8</strong></p>
                    <p>Player type B will receive <strong>E$ 12</strong></p>
                </td>
        </table>
        &nbsp;
        &nbsp;
    </div>

</div>

    &nbsp;
    <p>
        In the example above, one of the Type A participants receives E$12 if Participant B chooses Project X,
        and this Type A participant receives E$8 if Participant B chooses Project Y.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the example above, if Participant B chooses Project X,
        Participant B receives E$8. And if Participant B chooses Project Y, Participant B receives E$12.
    </p>

    <p>

        <strong>3)</strong> In each period, the third screen is the decision screen.
        Here, you will vote on whether Message X or Message Y should be sent to the Type B participant.
        On this decision screen, you can always see in the upper row whether you are subject A1, A2, or A3.

    </p>

    <p>

        Note,
        the bottom of this screen tells you how many votes are needed to make a decision as to whether to send Message X or Message Y.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using the computer mouse, please click on the field that indicates the decision that you want to make.

    <p>
        After you have clicked the button for Message X or Message Y, click on the next button to move to the next period,
        where you may be allocated a new subject number. With this new subject number you might also have a different number of votes,
        because each subject number is tied to the number of votes you see in the previous screen.
        There will be five periods of this part (Part 1) of the experiment,
        so that you are once A1, once A2, etc. in a random order, until you have cycled through all the five possibilities.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>4)</strong> Part 1 is ended by the following screen.
    </p>

    &nbsp;

    <div style ='background-color: white;border-radius: 25px; padding:20px;'>
    &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
<p>
    Part 1 is complete. Please click next and continue to the wait screen while the
    other players finish making their decisions. Part 2 will start when everyone
    has finished.
</p>
    &nbsp;
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Next</button>    &nbsp;
</div>

    &nbsp;

    <p>
         Once you have seen this screen, please press Next. You will then see a screen that announces the start of Part 2.
    </p>

    <p>
        Part 2 proceeds exactly as Part 1, except that some of the A1, A2, etc. have a different numbers of votes than in Part 1.
    </p>

    <p>

        After the second part is completed you will see a screen that summarizes your actions for both Part 1
        and Part 2 of the experiment and your personal earnings across all 6 periods.
