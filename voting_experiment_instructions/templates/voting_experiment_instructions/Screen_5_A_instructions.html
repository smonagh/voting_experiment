    <h1> How you earn money</h1>

    <p>Once Participant Type B has received the info which project was
       recommended to him or her to implement, Type B will choose between
       implementing between Project X and Project Y. </p>
<p>Your earnings and the earnings of the other Type A participants depend on
  which project Type B implements. Your earnings are the experimental dollar
   values associated with that project chose by Type B.</p>

    <p>Before and after choosing between the two projects, the Type B
      participant will not know
      of or learn of the earnings that he or she will receive when Project X
       or Project Y is implemented. Nor does Type B know of the earnings that
        Type A participants will receive when Project X or Project Y is
        implemented. </p>

    <p>The only information that the Type B participant has to make this choice
       between implementing Project X or Project Y is the message (Message X or
        Message Y) that your group of Type A participants has sent to him her
         via majority vote. Thus, Type B will only know the wording of the
         message that he or she received, i.e. either the wording of Message X
          or the wording of Message Y.  </p>

    <p>The Type B participant is also not informed about the decision rule that
       was used by Type A participants to send either Message X or Message Y.
        That is, Type B also does not know</p>
    <ul>
      <li>That the number of votes may have differed between Type A participants </li>
      <li>The identity of members of the group of Type A participants sent the message  </li>
      <li>That the decision which message to send to Type B was made via majority rule</li>
      <li>That a weighted voting method was used in making the decision which
         message to send to Type B.  </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In sum, the only information that Type B has to choose between Project X
       and Y is the message that Type A participants sent to him or her. </p>

    <p>Once Participant B has chosen between Project X and Project Y, a decision
       making round is completed.  Then, another decision making round starts.
        There are a total of 18 decision making rounds.</p>

    <p>Your earnings depend on which project was chosen by the Type B
      participant. Once Type B has announced his or her choice of project, one of the
      three Type A participants will receive the earnings associated with the
      project chosen by the Type B participant. In each round, the identity of the Type AÂ 
      participant who receives these earnings is randomly determined. </p>

    <p>As you do not know in which rounds you will receive earnings, your
       decisions/vote in each round might be relevant for how much money you will
        earn in this experiment. </p>

    <p>
      All participants will be informed how much money they earned In each
      round after all 18 rounds have been completed.
