    <i> How you earn money</i>
    <p>
        Participant B is asked to choose between Projects X and Y.
        The only information participant B has is the information sent to him or her in the message sent by your group
        of Type A participants. That is, the Type B participant will not know the value of the two projects,
        where the value is the payoff the Type A participants and the Type B participant will receive,
        depending on which project is chosen. The Type B participant is also not informed about the weighted voting procedure,
        that is, that the number of votes that members of Type A participants can cast may differ,
        nor that the message with the largest number of votes was sent
    </p>

    <p>
        Participant B then chooses between Project X and Project Y.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>In each period, exactly one of the Type A participants will receive a payment.</strong>
        This payment, and the payment to the Type B participant, is determined by the project chosen by the Type B participant.
        <strong>When making your decisions you will not know which period is relevant for your payment. Of the six periods of the experiment,
            you will be paid in two periods, that is you will be paid in one period in Part 1 and in one period in Part 2.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        As you do not know in which period you will be paid, your decisions in each period might be relevant for your personal earnings.
    </p>

    <p>
        All periods within Part 1 and 2, respectively,
        will be identical except that your subject number may change from period to period,
        and the other people in your group may change from period to period.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Part 2 everything is the same as Part 1, except for the number of votes participants
        A1, A2, and A3 hold. As before,
        the message that receives at least a 50% majority will be sent to Participant B
    </p>
