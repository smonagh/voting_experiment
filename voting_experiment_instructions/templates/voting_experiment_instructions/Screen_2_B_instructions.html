    <p> Welcome to todayâ€™s experiment! This is an experiment to learn how individuals make decisions. </p>

    <p>
        If you read the following instructions carefully,
        you will be able to earn money in addition to the show up bonus of US$6,
        which you will receive for participating in this study.
        The actual amount you will earn during this experiment depends on your decisions and the decisions of the other participants.
        Therefore it is important that you read these instructions carefully.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are interested in your decisions that you make on your own.
        That means, now that the experiment has started, no talking, please.
        Please turn off all electronic devices. If you have any questions at any time during the experiment,
        or have any trouble with the computer, please raise your hand, and we will come to you to answer your questions.
    </p>

        <strong>
            The experiment consists of two parts. Each part consists of three periods with one decision each period.
            Each decision is a self-contained experiment.
        </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        In each period, you will have an opportunity to earn experimental dollars, E$, which will be converted to US dollars at a rate of E$2 = US$1.
        At the conclusion of this experiment, a summary screen will display your total earnings including your US$6 show-up bonus.
        Please sit quietly after the experiment has concluded and wait to be called to receive your earnings in private and in cash.
    </p>

    <p>
        For cash payment purposes, you will be assigned a random identification number (ID).
