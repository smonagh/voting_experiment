        <h1>Welcome to today’s experiment!</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this experiment is to learn about decision making by individuals.</p>
        <p>In this experiment you can earn money which you will be paid in cash at the end of this experiment.</p>
        <p>How much money you will earn will depend on your decisions and the decisions of the other participants in this experiment. By making some decisions but not others, you will make choices that are either likely to increase your earnings, or are likely to decrease your earnings. These instructions explain the kind of decisions you can make. To earn money, it is important that you understand these instructions.</p>
        <p>We are interested in your decisions, that is, the decisions that you make on your own. This also means, from here on please no talking. Please turn off all electronic devices. If you have any questions during the experiment, or if you any trouble with the computer, please raise your hand. We will come to you to answer your questions.</p>
        <p>The following pages will explain the experiment in detail.</p>
        <p>The experiment consists of 30 decision-making rounds.</p>
        <p>Each round provides you with the potential to earn money, which is expressed in experimental dollars, E$. At the end of this experiment, your earnings in experimental dollars which will be converted to US dollars, US$, and your earnings in US$ will be paid to you. The conversion rate is 1 US dollar for 6 experimental dollars.</p>
        <p>At the end of this experiment, a summary screen will display your total earnings in US$.</p>
        <p>Please sit quietly after the experiment has concluded, and wait to be called to receive your earnings. You will receive your earnings in cash and paid privately which means that the other participants cannot observe how much money you earned.</p>
        <p>The following screens are providing you with a set of instructions for this experiment</p>


        <h1>Your Role and Decisions</h1>

        <p>A random procedure assigned some of the participants in this experiment to be Type A participants, and others to be Type B participants. This random procedure assigned you to be a Type B participant.</p>
        <p>In this experiment, there will be 30 decision making rounds. In each round, a decision will be made in groups that consist of 6 people. In each round, a group consists of five Type A participants A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5, and one Type B participant.</p>
        <p>The persons who were at the very start of the experiment were chosen to be of Type A, will remain a Type A participant throughout the experiment. And you will remain a type B participant throughout this experiment.</p>
        <p>For each decision you will be matched with five participants of Type A. The composition of the groups will change at random after each decision. For each decision your group might therefore consist of different participants.</p>
        <p>You will not learn of the identity of the other five participants in your group, neither before, nor after the study. Further, none of the other participants in your group will learn of your identity.</p>
        <p>In this experiment, you will choose one of two projects, Project X and Project Y. The earnings to you and to the participants of Type A depend on the project chosen by you. The only information you will have to make a choice between Project X or Y is a message that Type A participants will send to you.</p>
        <p>You will be sent one of two possible messages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Message X: “Project X will earn you more money than Project Y.”</p></li>
            <li><p>Message Y: “Project Y will earn you more money than Project X.”</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first screen tells you in which of the 30 rounds you are. So whether you are in the first, second, etc. round.</p>
        <p>After Type A participants decided which recommendation to send, you will see a second screen. One example of this second screen is below:</p>
        <div style = 'background-color: white;'>
        <p>Participants of Type A have decided to send you the message: "Project X will earn you more money than Project Y"</p>
        {% formfield player.decision_field with label="Please choose to implement either Project X or Project Y? : " %}
        </div>
        <p>In this example screen, the Type A participants sent the message to you that Project X will earn you more money than Project Y. Next you are asked to choose either Project X or Project Y. Your choice will determine your payments and the payments of Type A participants in the experiment.</p>
        <p>You will be informed about your personal earnings upon conclusion of the last decision, that is, after the 30th round of decision making.</p>
        <p>Please sit quietly after the experiment has concluded and wait to be called to receive your earnings.</p>
        <p>Do you have any questions? Please raise your hand and we will come to your cubicle.</p>
        <p>Once the next button appears you can click on it to advance to the following screen. That screen is a blank screen which will change once Type A participants have read their instructions and have made their first decision.</p>
