        <h1>Welcome to today’s experiment!</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this experiment is to learn about decision making by individuals.</p>
        <p>The money you earn in this experiment will be paid in cash at the end of the session.</p>
        <p>How much money you will earn will depend on both your decisions and the decisions of the other participants in this experiment. Each decisions you make may either increase or decrease your earnings These instructions explain the kind of decisions you can make. To earn money, it is important that you understand these instructions.</p>
        <p>At the end of this experiment, a summary screen will display your total earnings in US$.</p>
        <p>In order to make sure the decisions you make during this experiment are your own, please turn off all electronic devices and no not talk to anyone else in this session. If you have any questions during the experiment, or if you any trouble with the computer, please raise your hand. We will come to you to answer your questions.</p>
        <p>The following pages will explain the experiment in detail.</p>
        <p>The experiment consists of 30 decision-making rounds</p>
        <p>Each round provides you with the potential to earn money, which is expressed in experimental dollars, displayed as E$. At the end of this experiment, your earnings in experimental dollars which will be converted to US dollars, US$, and your earnings in US$ will be paid to you. The conversion rate is 1 US dollar for 6 experimental dollars. A computer will randomly select the rounds that will count towards your take home earnings.</p>
        <p>At the end of this experiment, a summary screen will display your total earnings in US$.</p>
        <p>Please sit quietly after the experiment has concluded, and wait to be called to receive your earnings. You will receive your earnings in cash and paid privately which means that the other participants cannot observe how much money you earned.</p>
        <p>The following screens are providing you with a set of instructions for this experiment</p>


        <h1>Your Role and Assignment</h1>

        <p>A random procedure has predetermined whether each participant is a type B or type A participant in the proceeding rounds. This random procedure assigned you to be a Type B participant.</p>
        <p>In this experiment, there will be30 decision making rounds. In each round, a five type A participants“ A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 “ and one Type B participant will make joint decisions which will determine the earnings of each participant in a given round. The Type you were assigned at the beginning of the session will remain the same throughout each round</p>        <p>The persons who were at the very start of the experiment were chosen to be of Type A, will remain a Type A participant throughout the experiment. And you will remain a type B participant throughout this experiment.</p>
        <p>For each round you will be matched with five participants of Type A. After each round the members of the Type A group will be randomly select. For each decision your group might therefore consist of different participants.</p>
        <p>You will not learn of the identity of the other five participants in your group. None of the other participants in your group will learn of your identity.</p>
        <p>In this experiment, you will choose one of two projects, Project X and Project Y. The earnings each type will depend on the project chosen by you. The only information you will have to make a choice between Project X or Y is a message that Type A participants will send to you.</p>
        <p>You will be sent one of two possible messages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Message X: “Project X will earn you more money than Project Y.”</p></li>
            <li><p>Message Y: “Project Y will earn you more money than Project X.”</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first screen tells you in which of the 30 rounds you are. So whether you are in the first, second, etc. round.</p>
        <p>After Type A participants decided which recommendation to send, you will see a second screen. One example of this second screen is below:</p>
        <div style = 'background-color: white;'>
        <p>Participants of Type A have decided to send you the message: "Project X will earn you more money than Project Y"</p>
        {% formfield player.decision_field with label="Please choose to implement either Project X or Project Y? : " %}
        </div>
        <p>In this example screen, the Type A participants sent the message to you that Project X will earn you more money than Project Y. Next you are asked to choose either Project X or Project Y. Your choice will determine your payments and the payments of Type A participants in the experiment.</p>
        <p>You will be informed about your personal earnings upon conclusion of the last decision, that is, after the 30th round of decision making.</p>
        <p>Please sit quietly after the experiment has concluded and wait to be called to receive your earnings.</p>
        <p>Do you have any questions? Please raise your hand and we will come to your cubicle.</p>
        <p>Once the next button appears you can click on it to advance to the following screen. That screen is a blank screen which will change once Type A participants have read their instructions and have made their first decision.</p>
