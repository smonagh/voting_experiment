    <h1>Welcome to today's experiment!</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this experiment is to learn about decision making by individuals.</p>
    <p>In this experiment you can earn money which you will be paid in cash at the end of this experiment.</p>
    <p>How much money you will earn will depend on your decisions and the decisions of the other participants in this experiment. By making some decisions but not others, you will make choices that are either likely to increase your earnings, or are likely to decrease your earnings. These instructions explain the kind of decisions you can make. To earn money, it is important that you understand these instructions.</p>
    <p>We are interested in your decisions, that is, the decisions that you make on your own. This also means, from here on please no talking. Please turn off all electronic devices. If you have any questions during the experiment, or if you any trouble with the computer, please raise your hand. We will come to you to answer your questions.</p>
    <p>The following pages will explain the experiment in detail.</p>
    <p>The experiment consists of 30 decision-making rounds.</p>
    <p>Each round provides you with the potential to earn money, which is expressed in experimental dollars, E$. At the end of this experiment, your earnings in experimental dollars which will be converted to US dollars, US$, and your earnings in US$ will be paid to you. The conversion rate is 1 US dollar for 6 experimental dollars.</p>
    <p>At the end of this experiment, a summary screen will display your total earnings in US$.</p>
    <p>Please sit quietly after the experiment has concluded, and wait to be called to receive your earnings. You will receive your earnings in cash and privately, Being paid privately means that the other participants cannot observe how much money you earned.</p>
    <p>The following screens are providing you with a set of instructions for this experiment.</p>
    <p>After these instructions, there will be a few screens that will test your understanding of these instructions. You and the other participants must answer each test question correctly before the experiment can proceed.</p>

    <h1>Your Role and the Sequence of Voting Decisions</h1>

    <p>A random procedure assigned some of the participants in this experiment to be Type A participants, and others to be Type B participants. This random procedure assigned you to be a Type A participant.</p>
    <p>In this experiment, there will be 30 decision making rounds. In each round, decisions will involve groups that consist of 6 people. In each round, a group consists of five Type A participants – A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 – and one Type B participant.</p>
    <p>In each of the 30 decision making rounds, you, as a Type A participant will be randomly assigned to one of the groups and you will be randomly assigned an identification number A1, A2, A3, A4, or A5 in that group. Thus, the identity of the other Type A participants in your group, and your identification number A1, A2, A3, A4, or A5 in can change from round to round.</p>
    <p>In each of the 30 making decision making rounds, also Type B participants are randomly assigned to one of the groups.</p>
    <p>You will not learn of the identity of the other participants in your group, neither before, nor after the study. Further, none of the other participants in your group will learn of your identity.</p>
    <p>In each of the 30 decision making rounds, each Type A participant will vote on whether to recommend to Type B to either implement Project X or Project Y.</p>
    <p>Prior to this vote, you and the other Type A participants will receive information about the earnings that you and other Type A participants receive if Type B implements Project X, and your earnings if Type B implements Project Y.</p>
    <p>Project X and Project Y may differ in that one has a larger earnings than the other. That is, your earnings are either smaller or larger, depending on which project is implemented.</p>
    <p>The Type B participant will make the decision whether to implement Project X or Project Y. Prior to this decision, Type A participants vote which message, either Message X or Message Y to send to the Type B participant:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Message X: “Project X will earn you more money than Project Y.”</p></li>
    <li><p>Message Y: “Project Y will earn you more money than Project X.”</p></li>
        </ul>
    <p>The only information that participant B will have for making the decision which project to implement is the wording of Message X (Project X will earn you more money than Project Y) or the wording of Message Y (Project Y will earn you more money than Project X), depending on which message was sent by Type A participants.</p>
    <p>After receiving the message that was sent by Type A voters, the Type B participant will decide which one of the two projects he or she chooses to implement.</p>

    <h1>The Voting Procedure</h1>

    <p>Which message the Type A participants will send to the Type B participant will be determined by the following majority rule voting procedure.</p>
    <p>This majority voting procedure is a weighted majority voting procedure because each of the Type A participants may have more than one vote that he or she can use to vote in favor of either sending Message X or Message Y. That is, some Type A participants may have more votes than other Type A participants.</p>
    <p>Each of the Type A participants will vote at the same time. Abstention from voting is not possible.</p>
    <p>Each of the Type A participants has to vote for either Message X or Message Y and use all of his or her votes for either of these two messages.</p>
    <p>After all Type A participants have voted either in favor sending Message X or Message Y to Type B, the software automatically and accurately sums the votes for each of the two messages. The message that receives at least 50 percent of the votes will be sent to the Type B participant.</p>
    <p>Note, because the number of votes to recommend either Message X or Message Y may differ between some Type A participants and other Type A participants, those Type A participants with more votes will have more influence on the decision which project will be recommended to Type B.</p>
    <p>As was mentioned before, this experiment assigns each of the five Type A participants with an identification, either A1, A2, A3, A4, or A5. Your identifier can change from decision making round to decision making round. In each round, the assignment of an identification number to a participant is randomly generated. For example, you may be person A2 in the first decision making round, A1, in the second round, A5 in the third round, A2 in the fourth round, etc.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of the screen that you will see prior to your voting decision. This table tells you your identification number. In this case, you are participant A1. This screen also informs you about the number of votes assigned to you and to the other four Type A participants.</p>


    <h3>You are now participant A1 – </h3>

    <table class = "table" style ='background-color: white; width: 85%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'>
        <tr style=" border: 1px; border-color:black; border-style:solid;" >
            <col width = '160px' />
            <col width = '160px' />
            <col width = '160px' />
            <col width = '160px' />
            <col width = '160px' />
            <col width = '160px' />

            <th ><strong>Type A Participant</strong></th>
            <th>A1 (You)</th>
            <th>A2</th>
            <th>A3</th>
            <th>A4</th>
            <th>A5</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th><strong>Number of Votes</strong></th>
            <th>3</th>
            <th>3</th>
            <th>3</th>
            <th>1</th>
            <th>1</th>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The sum of votes is <strong>11</strong></p>

    <p>In this screen example, you, as the A1 participant, have 3 votes, participant A2 has 3 votes, participant A3 has 3 votes, participant A4 has 1 vote and participant A5 has 1 vote. The total number of votes is the sum of the individual votes. So the total number of votes is 11 (3+3+3+1+1).</p>
    <p>After having received this information, and additional information about the earnings associated Project X and Project Y, as explained a little later in these instructions, you will vote to send either Message X or Message Y to participant Type B. If you have more than one vote, all of your votes will be given to your choice, being either Message X or to Message Y.</p>
    <p>Once Type A participants have voted, their votes for Message X and Message Y will be summed.</p>
    <p>Majority rule determines which message will be sent to Participant B. That message will be sent that receives at least 50% of the votes. In the example in the table above, given that the total number of votes is 11, the majority of votes is 6. - So, the message with at least 6 votes will be sent to participant B.</p>

    <h1>How you earn money</h1>


    <p>    Once Participant Type B has received the info which project was recommended to him or her, participant Type B will choose whether to implement Project X or Project Y.</p>
    <p>Your earnings and the earnings of the other Type A participants depend on which project Type B implements. Your earnings are the experimental dollar values associated with that project chose by Type B.</p>
    <p>Before and after choosing between the two projects, the Type B participant will not know of or learn of the earnings that he or she will receive when Project X or Project Y is implemented. Nor does Type B know of the earnings that Type A participants will receive when Project X or Project Y is implemented.</p>
    <p>The only information that the Type B participant has to make this choice between implementing Project X or Project Y is the message (Message X or Message Y) that your group of Type A participants has sent to him or her via majority vote. Thus, Type B will only know the wording of the message that he or she received, i.e. either the wording of Message X or the wording of Message Y.</p>
    <p>The Type B participant is also not informed about the decision rule that was used by Type A participants to send either Message X or Message Y. That is, Type B also does not know</p>


    <ul>
        <li>The identity of members of the group of Type A participants who sent the message</li>
        <li>That the decision which message to send to Type B was made via majority rule</li>
        <li>That a weighted voting method was used in making the decision which message to send</li>
        <li>That the number of votes may have differed between Type A participants.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>    In sum, the only information that Type B has to choose between Project X and Y is the message that Type A participants sent to him or her.</p>
    <p>Once Participant B has chosen between Project X and Project Y, a decision making round is completed. Then, another decision making round starts. There are a total of 30 decision making rounds.</p>
    <p>Your earnings depend on which project was chosen by the Type B participant. Once Type B has announced his or her choice of project, one of the five Type A participants will receive the earnings associated with the project chosen by the Type B participant. In each round, the identity of the Type A participant who receives these earnings is randomly determined.</p>
    <p>As you do not know in which rounds you will receive earnings, your decisions/votes in each round might be relevant for how much money you will earn in this experiment.</p>
    <p>At the conclusion of the 30th round, all participants will be informed how much money they have earned in each of the previous rounds.</p>

    <h1>The procedure on your computer screen</h1>
    <p>In each round, the first screen, shown below, informs you that you are Type A participant and informs you about your identification number in the round.
        You are now participant <strong>A1</strong>
The players in your group have the following number of votes

    <p>The sum of votes is <strong>11</strong> The project with at least <strong>6</strong> votes will be recommended to participant B</p>


    <p>  This example screen informs you that you (A1) have two votes, A2 has two votes, A3 has two votes, A4 has one vote, and A5 has one vote. The screen further informs you that the sum of the votes of all participants is 11, and that the project that receives at least 6 votes will be recommended to participant B.</p>
    <p>The other four Type A participants – A2, A3, A4 and A5 in this example – will see a similar screen as you, letting them know about their identification numbers and their number of votes.</p>
    <p>To move on to the next screen, click on “continue”.</p>
    <p>After having clicked “continue”, you and the other participants in your group will see the second screen. In each round, this second screen informs you and the other four Type A participants of your earnings when the Type B participant implemented either Project X or Project Y. All participants of Type A receive this information at the same time, and prior to the vote.</p>
    <p>Below is an example screen containing the earnings associated with Projects X and Y.</p>

       </div>
            &nbsp;
     </div>

    <p>This screen informs you that if project X is chosen to be implemented by Type B, each of the Type A participants will earn E$16 and the Type B participant will earn E$4.</p>
    <p>This screen further informs you that if project Y is chosen to be implemented by Type B, each of the Type A participants will earn E$4 and the Type B participant will earn E$16.</p>
    <p>Recall, at the end of the decision making round, one of the five Type A participants will be randomly chosen to receive the earnings.</p>
    <p>To move on to the next screen, click on “continue”.</p>


<p>In each round, the third screen is the decision screen. Here, you will vote on whether to send Message X or Message Y to the Type B participant.</p>
    <p>On this decision screen, you are reminded in the upper row whether you are person A1, A2. A3, A4 or A5, and about the number of votes of each participant.</p>
    <p>At the bottom of this screen you are reminded how many votes are needed for the majority rule procedure to send either Message X or Message Y to the Type B participant.</p>
    <p>As noted previously, the Type B participant has no information about the earnings associated with either of the two projects. The Type B participant is also not informed about the procedure (total number of votes, votes assigned to each voter, and that a 50% majority of votes is required for a message to be sent to Type B).</p>
    <p>To vote whether to send Message X or Message Y to participant B, use the computer mouse to click on that field which indicates the message for which you would like to vote.</p>


       <p>
           After you have clicked the button for either sending Message X or sending Message Y, you will advance automatically to the next round. In this next round, the persons/students (that is, the other four Type A participants and the Type B participant) of your group to which you are assigned may differ from the persons/students in the previous round or rounds. You and the other potentially new four Type A participants also may have different number of votes than participants had in the previous round or rounds. You may also have a different identification number than you had in earlier rounds.
