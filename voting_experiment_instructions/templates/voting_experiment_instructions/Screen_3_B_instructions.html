    <p>
        In this experiment, you will interact in groups of four participants.
        You will not learn the identity of these participants, neither before nor after the study.
        None of the other participants will learn of your identity. The experiment consists of ten decisions.
    </p>


    <p>

        At the beginning of this experiment,
        we allocated three out of any four participants in this experiment to be participants of Type A
        and one out of any four to be a participant of Type B. This allocation was made randomly.
        This random procedure allocated you to be a <strong>Type B</strong> participant.

    </p>

    <p>
        For each decision, you will be matched with five participants of Type A. The composition of the groups will change at random after each decision.
        For each decision your group will therefore consist of different participants.
    </p>

    <p>

        In this experiment, you will choose one of two projects, Project X and Project Y.
        The payments to you and to the participants of Type A depend on the project chosen by you.
        We provided Type A participants with information about the payoffs for Type A participants
        and your payoff associated with each of the two projects.
        The only information you will have to make a choice between Project X or Y is a message that Type A participants
        will send to you.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will be sent one of two possible messages:

        <ul>
            Message X: “Project X will earn you more money than Project Y.”
        </ul>

        <ul>
            Message Y: “Project Y will earn you more money than Project X.”
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The following screens are example screens. You see in the upper row the number of the decision that you make,
        indicating to you at which of the ten periods you are in this experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
        After Type A participants decided which message to send, you will see the following screen:
    </p>

    <div style = 'background-color: white; border-radius: 25px; padding:20px;'>
        <p>
    Participants have decided to send you the message : 'Project X will earn you more money than Project Y'
    </p>
        <p>Will you choose project X or project Y?</p>

            <label><input type="radio" name="optradio">Project X</label>
            &nbsp;
            <label><input type="radio" name="optradio">Project Y</label>
    </div>

    <p>

        You will then be asked to choose either Project X or Project Y.
        Your choice will determine your payments and the payments of Type A participants in the experiment.

    </p>

    <p>
        You will be informed about your personal earnings upon conclusion of the last decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please sit quietly after the experiment has concluded and wait to be called to receive your earnings.
    </p>
