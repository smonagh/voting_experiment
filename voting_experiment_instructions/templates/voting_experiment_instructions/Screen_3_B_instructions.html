    <h1>Your Role and the Sequence of Voting Decisions</h1>

    <p>A random procedure assigned some of the participants in this experiment
       to be Type A participants, and others to be Type B participants. This
        random procedure assigned you to be a Type B participant.</p>

    <p>In this experiment, there will be 18 decision making rounds. In each
      round, a decision will be made in groups that consist of 4 people.
        In each round, a group consists of three Type A participants A1, A2, and
         A3, and one Type B participant.</p>

    <p>There are 24 participants in this experiment, so there will be 6 groups,
       and each group will have 4 participants.</p>

    <p>The persons who were at the very start of the experiment were chosen to
       be of Type A, will remain a Type A participant throughout the experiment.
        And you will remain a type B participant throughout this experiment.</p>

    <p>For each decision you will be matched with three participants of Type A.
       The composition of the groups will change at random after each decision.
        For each decision your group might therefore consist of different
         participants. </p>

    <p>You will not learn of the identity of the other three participants in
      your group, neither before, nor after the study. Further,
       none of the other participants in your group will learn of your identity.
    </p>

    <p>In this experiment, you will choose one of two projects, Project X and
       Project Y. The earnings to you and to the participants of Type A depend
        on the project chosen by you. We provided Type A participants with
         information about the earnings for Type A participants and your
          earnings assuming you chose Project X, and we provide the same
           information assuming you chose Project Y. The only information you
            will have to make a choice between Project X or Y is a message that
             Type A participants will send to you.
    </p>

        <p> You will be sent one of two possible messages:</p>

      <ul> Message X: “Project X will earn you more money than Project Y.”</ul>

      <ul> Message Y: “Project Y will earn you more money than Project X.”</ul>

  <p>In the first screen, tells you in which of the 18 rounds you are.
    So whether you are in the first, second, etc. round.</p>

  <p>After Type A participants decided which recommendation to send,
     you will see a second screen. One example of this second screen is below:  </p>

  <img src = "{% static 'voting_experiment_instructions/decision_screenshot.png' %}" width=900>
  &nbsp;
  <p>In this example screen, the Type A participants sent the message to you
     that Project X will earn you more money than Project Y. Next you are asked
      to choose either Project X or Project Y. Your choice will determine your
       payments and the payments of Type A participants in the experiment.</p>

  <p>You will be informed about your personal earnings upon conclusion of the
     last decision, that is, after the 18th round of decision making. </p>

  <p>Please sit quietly after the experiment has concluded and wait
     to be called to receive your earnings. </p>

  <p>Do you have any questions? Please raise your hand and we will
    come to your cubicle. </p>

 <p>Once the next button appears you can click on it to advance to the
   following screen. That scrreen is a blank screen which will change once
   Type A participants have read their instrucctions and have made their
    first decision. </p>
